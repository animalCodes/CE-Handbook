          <h1>Controlling your ship</h1>
        </header>
        <intro>
          <h3>So, you've got your hands on a spaceship, neat. But how do you actually <em>move</em> it? That's what this page is for.</h3><br>
          <p>There is three main ways to control your ship: With a compass, 'Direct Control', and signs.</p>

            <h2>Compass control</h2>
            <p>This is the main way you will control your ship, and also arguably the simplest. All you need to do is grab a compass (you should already have one), pilot your ship, and right-click with your compass in the direction you want to go, easy!</p>

            <h2>Gear control</h2>
            <img src="/images/screenshots/gears.png" alt="Error loading image" id="gears">
            <label for="gears">Example of changing gears</label>
            <p>Now that you can move your ship you've probably noticed it's <em>goddamn slow!</em> Fortunately, there is a solution. <br>To change gears, with compass in hand hold shift and right-click, this will cycle through however many gears your craft has available, the higher the number, the faster you go!</p>

            <subarticle>
              <h2>Direct control</h2>
              <img src="/images/screenshots/direct-control.png" alt=" " id="direct-control">
              <label for="direct-control">Chat message for entering/leaving direct control</label>
              <p>Direct control allows you to move your ship like you would the player, for instance to go 'foward' you just press <strong>w</strong>, (or whatever you have 'walk foward' bound to) And to go down hold <strong>shift</strong>/crouch. However to go 'up' you must right-click with your compass.<br>
              To enter Direct control you just left-click with your compass, to exit, do the same.</p>
            </subarticle>
            <subarticle>
              <h2>Signs</h2>
              <p>Signs are the one necessary control method, even if you don't have a compass, you can still move using signs alone! Below are the different signs and what they do.<br></p>
              <h3>Pilot signs</h3>
              <img src="/images/screenshots/starfighter.png" alt="Sign with 'starfighter' written on it">
              <p>This is probably the most important sign of them all, allowing you to actually <em>control</em> your craft.<br>
              to make a pilot sign you just need to write the name of the craft on the top line of a sign. And then right-click it to pilot your craft.<br>
              If, for whatever reason the pilot sign isn't working you can always take control of your ship by writing <cmd>/pilot {craft name}</cmd>.<br>
              A full list of craft types along with their stats can be found <a href="/movecraft/crafts.html">here</a></p>
