      <h1>Controlling your ship</h1>
    </header>
    <intro>
      <p>There are three main ways to control your ship: With a compass, 'Direct Control', and signs.</p>
    </intro>
    <subarticle id="compass">
      <h3>Compass control</h3>
      <p>This is the main way you will control your ship, and also arguably the simplest. All you need to do is
        grab a compass, pilot your ship, and right-click with your compass in the direction you want to go.</p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="gears">
      <h3>Gear control</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../images/movecraft/gears.jpg" aria-labelledby="gears-img">
      <p id="gears-label">Chat message for gearshift - cycling through gears 1, 2, 3</p>
    </div>
      <p>Changing gears allows you to go faster/slower, for instance at gear 1 you might move one block per
        action, but in gear 3 you could move 3 blocks per action.</p>
      <p>To change gears, with compass in hand hold <strong>shift</strong> and
        <strong>right-click</strong>, this will cycle through however many gears your craft has available, different
        ships will
        have different gears available.
      </p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="direct">
      <h3>Direct control</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../images/movecraft/direct-control.jpg" aria-labelledby="direct-label">
      <p id="direct-label">Chat messages for entering and leaving direct control</p>
    </div>
      <p>Direct control allows you to move your ship like you would the player, for instance to go 'foward' you
        just press <strong>w</strong>, (or whatever you have 'walk foward' bound to) And to go down hold
        <strong>shift</strong>/crouch. However to go 'up' you must <strong>right-click</strong> with your compass.
      </p>
      <p>To enter Direct control you just <strong>left-click</strong> with your compass, to exit, do the same.</p>
    </subarticle>
    <h2>Signs</h2>
    <p>Signs are the one necessary control method, even if you don't have a compass, you can still move using
      signs alone, (I discovered this the hard way) below are the different signs and what they do.</p>
    <subarticle id="pilot">
      <h3>Pilot signs</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../images/signs/pilot.jpg" aria-labelledby="pilot-label">
      <p id="pilot-label">A pilot sign for a starfighter, literally just a sign with starfighter on it.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The most important sign of them all, allowing you to actually <em>pilot</em> your craft.</p>
      <p>to make a pilot sign you just need to write the name of the craft on the top line of a sign. And then
        <strong>right-click</strong> it to pilot your craft.</p>
      <p>If, for whatever reason the pilot sign isn't working you can always take control of your ship by writing <cmd>
          /pilot {craft type}</cmd>
      </p>
      <p>A list of all craft types along with their stats can be found <a href="crafts.html">here</a></p>
      </p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="helm">
      <h3>Helm sign</h3>
      <img src="../images/signs/helm.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Another important sign, and the only one that can't be replicated with commands, the helm sign allows you
        to turn your craft, <strong>right-click</strong> (Or whatever you have 'Use item/Place block' bound to) the sign
        to go right and <strong>left-click</strong> (Attack/Destroy) the sign to go left.</p>
      <p>To make a helm place a sign and write <cmd>[helm]</cmd> on the top line. After closing the GUI the sign
        will appear as above.</p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="cruise">
      <h3>Cruise signs</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../images/signs/cruise.jpg" aria-labelledby="cruise-label">
      <p id="cruise-label">A cruise sign in it's 'off' state</p>
      </div>
      <p>Cruise signs, while not a necessary addition to your ship, are very useful for long journeys. When you
        <strong>right-click</strong> a cruise sign your piloted ship will automatically move in the direction the sign
        is facing,
        you can also create ascend or descend signs that have the same effect but move your craft up or down
        respectively, to make a cruise sign write <cmd>cruise</cmd> on the top line of a sign, or <cmd>ascend
        </cmd> for an ascend sign etc.
      </p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="release">
      <h3>Release signs</h3>
      <img src="../images/signs/release.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Normally to release your ship you just enter <cmd>/release</cmd> in chat, but if, for instance. You are
        working on a ship and regularly need to be piloting/releasing it having to type <cmd>/release</cmd> every
        time can get irritating. Fortunately, there is a solution, when you right-click a release sign your
        currently piloted craft is released, so you don't need to bother with commands</p>
      <p>To create a release sign just write <cmd>release</cmd> on the top line of a sign.</p>
    </subarticle>
    <subarticle id="secure">
      <h3>Pilot: signs</h3>
      <div class="img-wrapper">
      <img src="../images/signs/secure.jpg" aria-labelledby="secure-label">
      <p id="secure-label">A pilot sign with animalchaser on the second line, thus preventing any player who isn't animalchaser from piloting the craft</p>
    </div>
      <p>It is important to note that Pilot: signs are very different to what I refer to as 'Pilot' signs, where
        Pilot signs let you <em>pilot</em> your craft, Pilot: signs are a security measure, preventing other
        players from piloting the ship they are placed on.</p>
      <p>To create a Pilot: sign just write <cmd>Pilot:</cmd> on the top line of a sign, once you close the GUI the
        second line will automatically populate with your username.</p>
      <p>More players can be added to the sign with the <cmd>/es {line number} {new text}</cmd> command.</p>
