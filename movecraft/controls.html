          <h1>Controlling your ship</h1>
        </header>
        <intro>
          <p>There are three main ways to control your ship: With a compass, 'Direct Control', and signs.</p>
        </intro>
        <article>
          <subarticle id="compass">
            <h3>Compass control</h3>
            <p>This is the main way you will control your ship, and also arguably the simplest. All you need to do is
              grab a compass (you should already have one), pilot your ship, and right-click with your compass in the
              direction you want to go.</p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="gears">
            <h3>Gear control</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/gears.png" id="gears-img">
            <label for="gearsimg">Example of changing gears</label>
            <p>Changing gears allows you to go faster/slower, for instance at gear 1 you will move one block per action,
              but in gear 3 you will move 3 blocks per action. <br>To change gears, with compass in hand hold shift and
              right-click, this will cycle through however many gears your craft has available, different ships will
              have different gears available.</p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="direct">
            <h3>Direct control</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/direct-control.png" id="direct-control-img">
            <label for="direct-control-img">Chat message for entering/leaving direct control</label>
            <p>Direct control allows you to move your ship like you would the player, for instance to go 'foward' you
              just press <strong>w</strong>, (or whatever you have 'walk foward' bound to) And to go down hold
              <strong>shift</strong>/crouch. However to go 'up' you must right-click with your compass.<br>
              To enter Direct control you just left-click with your compass, to exit, do the same.
            </p>
          </subarticle>
          <h2>Signs</h2>
          <p>Signs are the one necessary control method, even if you don't have a compass, you can still move using
            signs alone, (I discovered this the hard way) below are the different signs and what they do.<br></p>
          <subarticle id="pilot">
            <h3>Pilot signs</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/pilot.png" id="pilot-img">
            <label for="pilot-img">Example of a pilot sign</label>
            <p>The most important sign of them all, allowing you to actually <em>pilot</em> your craft.<br>
              to make a pilot sign you just need to write the name of the craft on the top line of a sign. And then
              right-click it to pilot your craft.<br>
              If, for whatever reason the pilot sign isn't working you can always take control of your ship by writing
              <cmd>/pilot {craft type}</cmd>.<br>
              A list of all craft types along with their stats can be found <a href="crafts.html">here</a>
            </p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="helm">
            <h3>Helm sign</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/helm.png" id="helm-img">
            <label for="helm-img">A helm sign</label>
            <p>Another important sign, and the only one that can't be replicated with commands, the helm sign allows you
              to turn your craft by right-clicking to go right and left-clicking to go left.<br>
              To make a helm place a sign and write <cmd>[helm]</cmd> on the top line. After closing the GUI the sign
              will appear as above.</p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="cruise">
            <h3>Cruise signs</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/cruise.png" id="cruise-img">
            <label for="cruise-img">A cruise sign</label>
            <p>Cruise signs, while not a necessary addition to your ship, are very useful for long journeys. When you
              right-click a cruise sign your piloted ship will automatically move in the direction the sign is facing,
              you can also create ascend or descend signs that have the same effect but move your craft up or down
              respectively, to make a cruise sign write <cmd>cruise</cmd> on the top line of a sign, or <cmd>ascend</cmd> for an ascend sign etc.</p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="release">
            <h3>Release signs</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/release.png" id="release-img">
            <label for="release-img">A release sign</label>
            <p>Normally to release your ship you just enter <cmd>/release</cmd> in chat, but if, for instance. You are
              working on a ship and regularly need to be piloting/releasing it having to type <cmd>/release</cmd> every
              time can get irritating. Fortunately, there is a solution, when you right-click a release sign your
              currently piloted craft is released, so you don't need to bother with commands.<br>
              To create a release sign just write <cmd>release</cmd> on the top line of a sign.</p>
          </subarticle>
          <subarticle id="secure">
            <h3>Pilot: signs</h3>
            <img src="../images/screenshots/secure.png" id="secure-img">
            <label for="secure-img">A Pilot: sign</label>
            <p>It is important to note that Pilot: signs are very different to what I refer to as 'Pilot' signs, where
              Pilot signs let you <em>pilot</em> your craft, Pilot: signs are a security measure, preventing other
              players from piloting the ship they are placed on.<br>
              To create a Pilot: sign just write <cmd>Pilot:</cmd> on the top line of a sign, once you close the GUI the
              second line will automatically populate with your username.</p>
