          <h2>When constructing your next <strike>warship</strike> merchant craft, it's important to choose the correct craft type. This page lists the different craft types along with their stats to help you decide.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Most craft require Flight blocks, these provide 'lift' to the craft, These will be referred to as <em>Fblocks</em>.</li>
            <li>Engine blocks are similar to Flight blocks, they provide 'thrust' to the craft, and will be referred as <em>Eblocks</em>.</li>
            <li>All craft will limit how many Chests/Barrels you can have on them, (<em>Sblocks</em>) each craft has the maximum percentage of these blocks listed.</li>
            <li>For a list of block types for a specific craft, click on it's title. Below is a list of all craft types and their
            stats.</li>
