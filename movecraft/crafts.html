          <h2 style="color: red;">PLEASE NOTE: as of 2022/01/18 this and the blocks page are pretty much redundant due to c_corp creating the <a href="https://starmap.zapto.org/craftdata" target="_blank">craftdata</a> page on the official website, I will still work on this page so that this handbook is as complete as it can be, but I recommend you go there for more detailed info.</h2>
          <h2>If you want to build a spaceship, it can be hard to choose what specific craft type to go for. Hopefully,
            this page will help you decide.</h2>
          <p>Most craft require a certain percentage of themselves to be 'flight blocks' which I will refer to as
            <em>Fblocks</em>. And engine blocks (<em>Eblocks</em>) in order to function.
            Additionally, most craft types will restrict how much of a certain block you can have on it, such as chests
            or barrels.
            (<em>Sblocks</em>) For a block guide see <a href="/movecraft/blocks.html">Valid blocks</a>. Below is a list
            of all craft types and their stats.</p>

          <h2>Spaceships</h2>
          <p>Spaceships are the main craft type of the Celestial Expanse as they are the only craft type able to travel
            between planets.</p>

            <p>Starfighters are the smallest and lightest spaceship, good for moving between bases / light defence but
              not much else, they are the only spaceship incapable of using a rift drive, and so are a poor choice for
              interplanetary travel. When you first join starcivs you will be given a S.I.B for a 'Guppie', which is a
              starfighter.</p>

            <p>Cargoshuttles are pretty much identical to starfighters with one key advantage: they can use <em>Rift
                drives</em>! For more info on rift drives see <a href="/planets/travel.html">Interplanetary travel</a>
              but TL:DR they let you warp between the orbits of planets. Making cargoshuttles ideal for quickly moving
              between planets.</p>
