    <intro>
      <p>The Celestial Expanse can be a bit overwhelming to new players due to the sheer amount of stuff to do,
        places to see, etc. This guide is made to help new players get started on the server.</p>
    </intro>
    <subarticle>
      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>There are a few things you should do before you start playing, firstly, there are custom items and blocks
        that require a resource pack to use properly, secondly, a fabric modpack has been made by <strike>our
          glorious leader</strike>
        <sig style="color: #ee5e01;">C_Corp2002</sig> which while not strictly <em>required</em> to
        play on the server does help with optimisation/performance. <a
          href="https://celestialmc.zapto.org/resourcepacks" target="_blank">for download links, click here.</a>
        If you don't know what
        fabric is then you should probably skip the modpack, it isn't required anyway.

      <h3>Getting to earth</h3>
      <p>You will first spawn at the <em>OrbitHub</em>, a station floating in the void, to get to earth just go
        through the portal. (this will be behind you when you first spawn)</p>
      <p>Once you go through the portal, you will be in the air above earth with slow falling, you should use this
        opportunity to look around and see where would be a good landing spot.</p>

      <h3>Piloting your ship</h3>
      <img alt="" src="../images/screenshots/starfighter.png" id="guppie-img">
      <label aria-hidden="true" for="guppie-img">A modified guppie</label>
      <p>One of the items you will start with will be a barrel called '<em class="gold">Structure Box</em>',
        placing this will spawn in a LiFi Guppie starter ship. Note that once placed it can't be put back in the
        box so only do so when you are sure you want to.</p>
      <p>The LiFi Guppie is a starfighter equipped with a <a href="../structures/gadgets.html#shield">shield</a>
        and PDLC, to enter the cockpit stand on the gray
        carpet below the spruce trapdoor and press <strong>shift</strong>/crouch. This is an <a
          href="../structures/gadgets.html#elevator">elevator</a>, for information on how to control your ship,
        see the <a href="../movecraft/controls.html">Signs /
          Controls page.</a></p>

      <h3>Getting off earth</h3>
      <p>Once you have gotten some better gear you may be tempted to go to another planet, you should first know
        which planet you want to go to, I recommend going to the <a href="https://starmap.zapto.org/starmap/"
          target="_blank">Starmap</a> as it will allow you to get a rough idea of the terrain of each planet, once
        decided refer to the <a href="../planets/travel.html#orbits">orbit names table</a> to get the planets
        orbit, this will be important when setting up your rift drive.</p>
      <p>To travel between planets you require a rift drive, note that starfighters cannot use rift drives and you
        will need at least a cargoshuttle to use one, for more info on craft types and their different abilities
        see <a href="../movecraft/crafts.html">Craft types</a>, However a guppie can easily be outfitted to
        function as a cargoshuttle by adding more wool. Once outfitted you will need to <a
          href="../planets/travel.html#riftdrives">setup a rift drive and
          teleport sign</a>.</p>

      <h3>Joining a town</h3>
      <p>The rules of the Celestial Expanse are such that unprotected chests/containers are fair game, and so
        joining/founding a town is recommended so that you can protect your items.</p>
      <p>To join a town you will first need an <em>invite</em>, if you want to join a town you should ask on the
        #towns-and-nations channel on the discord server, if you are lucky a mayor will offer to invite you to
        their town.</p>
      <p>Some towns don't require an invite, typing <cmd>/t list</cmd> will display a list of all towns, if the
        town has (open) after it's name this means any player can join the town without an invite, in this case do
        <cmd>/t join {town name}</cmd> to join it.
